This is a thesis template. It's intended to help the reader quickly get up and running on their thesis.

to use this you should have pdflatex on your terminal
to compile, run `pdflatex thesis.tex`

Also consider getting hunspell so you can do spell check in the terminal
(any extra words you'd like in your dictionary should be added to 'words.txt')

the script compile.sh shows you how to add in changes made to the references
after changing the references, run `source compile.sh`

Good luck with your thesis! Start early for best results!
